* Part 1
** Problem
1. Take a list of pairs of characters. List is separated by newlines, pairs are separated by spaces.
2. Each pair represents what your opponent plays then what you play.
3. Score according to these tables
   | Your Play | Score |
   | X         |     1 |
   | Y         |     2 |
   | Z         |     3 |

   | Outcome | Score |
   | Lose    |     0 |
   | Tie     |     3 |
   | Win     |     6 |

** Solution
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle Part1.hs
main :: IO ()
main = do
  txt <- readFile "data.txt"
  let ints = map ((\x -> rockPaperScissorsScore x + playScore x) . map head . words) $ lines txt
  print $ sum ints
  where
    r = read :: String -> Int

rockPaperScissorsScore :: String -> Int
rockPaperScissorsScore s
  | s == "AZ" || s == "BX" || s == "CY" = 0
  | s == "AY" || s == "BZ" || s == "CX" = 6
  | otherwise = 3

playScore :: String -> Int
playScore (_ : s : []) =
  case s of
    'X' -> 1
    'Y' -> 2
    'Z' -> 3
    _ -> 0

* Part 2
** Problem
1. Take a list of pairs of characters. List is separated by newlines, pairs are separated by spaces.
2. Each pair represents what your opponent plays then whether you need to lose, tie, or win.
3. Find out what you're supposed to play.
4. Score according to these tables
   | Your Play | Score |
   | X         |     1 |
   | Y         |     2 |
   | Z         |     3 |

   | Outcome | Score |
   | Lose    |     0 |
   | Tie     |     3 |
   | Win     |     6 |
